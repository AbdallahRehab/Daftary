# Specification Quality Checklist: Reports & Data/Privacy Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No open [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. The two genuinely open implementation questions (exact export file format; exact default trend window length) were resolved with documented senior defaults in the Assumptions section rather than left as blockers, since neither affects this feature's functional requirements, testability, or the destructive-action safety requirements — both are presentation/format details appropriate to decide at `/speckit-plan` time.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
